Overview

This repository contains an exploratory unsupervised learning project that uses clustering to analyze and segment data. 
The main work is done in a Jupyter Notebook (Unsupervised-learning-project.ipynb), where different clustering techniques are applied, evaluated, and visualized to derive insights.

Key goals of the project:

Apply clustering (K‑Means) on the dataset

Evaluate cluster quality using metrics like inertia and silhouette score

Interpret clusters and derive actionable insights



What’s Inside the Notebook

Here is a breakdown of the notebook structure:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Inspect the scaled dataset, check distributions, PCA.

Clustering Loop – Try different numbers of clusters (k) using K‑Means; compute inertia and silhouette score.

Cluster Evaluation – Plot/elbow method for inertia, silhouette scores, and decide the optimal k.

Cluster Interpretation – Analyze cluster centroids or cluster profiles, interpret each cluster meaningfully.

Make Recommendations.
